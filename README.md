# Website design practice
Hey you! I will start recreating some websites in order to practice (a lot) my website designs skills, how? That it is simple, Frontend Practice is a library of company's websites which provides resources and projects so you can start practicing with meaty websites.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Frontend Practice</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Up for the challenge?</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

I would like to share that this repository is created for just one purpose, and it is to recreate websites provided by Frontend Practice. 
**I do not have any negative intentions** with the websites I am going to recreate but to practice a lot my website design skills and reinforce topics I may have forgotten. 
I am aware in regards of the rights of each company or development team who carefully created their websites, **I do not want to replace the code** neither disrespect each company's websites I am going to recreate.
